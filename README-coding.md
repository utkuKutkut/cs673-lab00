## Coding Exercises

There are four coding exercises below, which you can solve in preparation for taking CS673.

### Task 0: IDE Setup & Github Actions
- Here's a step-by-step guide to using intelliJ and Gradle to import this starter code: [README](https://github.com/hadenlee/cs673-f20-lab00/blob/master/intelliJ/README.md)  
- Note that in your remote Github repository, you can visit `Actions` which will simply run all unit tests on their server.   
As such, you can push your commits to the remote repo, and wait for the server to 'grade' your commits. (Simply click on the `Actions` tab at the top when you visit your remote repository's main page.)
- Not familiar with Github and/or Github Actions? Learn more about them [here](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/) and [here](https://help.github.com/en/actions/getting-started-with-github-actions/about-github-actions).

### Task 1: Climbing Steps
- Description

   Let's say you need to climb a staircase that has `n` steps (`1 <= n <= 2020`).  
   You can climb either 1 step or 2 steps at a time.  
   You're wondering in how many different ways you can climb up the `n` steps to the top.  
- Examples

   When `n = 1`: You can take 1 step to reach the top, and the answer is 1.  
   When `n = 2`: You can either two separate 1-steps or you can take two steps all at once. The answer is 2.  
   When `n = 3`: There are three different ways: `1 + 1 + 1` or `1 + 2` or `2 + 1`.  
   When `n = 4`: There are four different ways: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1` or `1 + 1 + 2` or `1 + 2 + 1` or `2 + 1 + 1`.  
- Implementations and Tests

   Try to solve this problem once iteratively and once recursively.  
   See [`Task1.java`](src/main/java/edu/usfca/cs673/).  
   See [`TestTask1.java`](src/test/java/edu/usfca/cs673/) for unit tests with more examples.  
   Note that the answer can easily become large, so you should return the answer modulo 99991 (i.e., `return (answer) % MOD` in your code).

### Task 2: Inversions
- Description
   You are given an array `A` of `n` *distinct* integers (`1 <= n <= 100`).  
   An *inversion* is a pair of indices (i, j) where (i < j) and `A[i] > A[j]` are both true (with `0 <= i, j, < n`, using 0-based index).  
   Given `A` as input, write a method that counts and returns the number of inversions in `A`.

- Examples

  When `A = [1, 2, 3]`: There are no inversions. The answer is 0.  
  When `A = [20, 10]`: There is one inversion, `(0, 1)` as 0 < 1 and `A[0] > A[1]`.  
  When `A = [20, 10, 30]`: There is still one inversion, `(0, 1)` as 0 < 1 and `A[0] > A[1]`.  
  When `A = [30, 20, 10]`: There are three inversions: `(0, 1)`, `(0, 2)`, and `(1, 2)`.

- Implementations and Tests

   Try to solve this problem with an efficient algorithm (i.e., better than a quadratic algorithm that's trivial). If you can't solve this in sub-quadratic time, that's OK because we'll study it in CS673. :)  
   See [`Task2.java`](src/main/java/edu/usfca/cs673/).  
   See [`TestTask2.java`](src/test/java/edu/usfca/cs673/) for unit tests with more examples.

### Task 3: Counting
- Description
  
   Suppose we have `2n` students in a class, and we need to divide them into two teams of `n` students each (for a friendly match between the teams).  
   In how many different ways can we divide them into two teams of the same size?  
   Assume that `1 <= n <= 30`.

- Examples
   
   When `n = 1`: There are two students, say `A` and `B`. We can divide them into `[A]` and `[B]` (hence, the answer is 1).  
   When `n = 2`: There are four students, say `A, B, C, D`. We can do: `[A, B], [C, D]`, `[A, C], [B, D]`, and `[A, D], [B, C]`. The answer is 3. (Note that `[A, C] vs [B, D]` and `[B, D] vs [A, C]` would be the same split, so it's counted only once.)  
   When `n = 3`: There are six students (`A`-`F`). The answer is 10: `[A, B, C], [D, E, F]`, `[A, B, D], [C, E, F]`, `[A, B, E], [C, D, F]`, `[A, B, F], [C, D, E]`, `[A, C, D], [B, E, F]`, `[A, C, E], [B, D, F]`, `[A, C, F], [B, D, E]`, `[A, D, E], [B, C, F]`, `[A, D, F], [B, C, E]`, and `[A, E, F], [B, C, D]`.
- Implementations and Tests

   See [`Task3.java`](src/main/java/edu/usfca/cs673/).  
   See [`TestTask3.java`](src/test/java/edu/usfca/cs673/) for unit tests with more examples.  
   Note that the answer can easily become large, so you should return the answer modulo 99991 (i.e., `return (answer) % MOD` in your code).

### Task 4: Probability
- Description
  
   Suppose that you have `n` [fair coins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_coin), which you toss at the same time. Let `n1` be the number of coins with heads and `n2 = n - n1` be the number of coins with tails.
   Let `p(k)` be the probability that `|n1 - n2| = k`.
   Calculate this probability, given `n` and `k` (assume `0 <= k <= n <= 20`).
   
- Examples

   When `n = 2, k = 0`: As `k = 0`, we must have one head and one tail. Out of four (equiprobable) outcomes (`HH`, `HT`, `TH`, `TT`), there are two such outcomes -- the answer is 0.5.  
   When `n = 3, k = 0`: This is impossible because `n = 3` (`|n1 - n2|` can get as small as 1, but not 0). The answer is 0.  
   When `n = 4, k = 0`: This means we must have two heads and two tails. Out of sixteen (equiprobable) outcomes, there are six such outcomes, and the answer is 6/16 = 0.375.   
   When `n = 4, k = 4`: This means either we have all tails or all heads. The answer is 2/16 = 0.125.  
   When `n = 5, k = 1`: This means we get two heads and three tails OR three heads and two tails. 20/32 = 0.625 is the answer.

### Task 5: Extra Stuff (optional)
- Task 1: If `n` could be as large as `10^9`, would your solution still work fast enough?
- Task 2: If `n` could be as large as `10^6`, would your solution still work fast enough?
- Task 3: If `n` could be as large as `10^5`, would your solution still work fast enough?
- Task 4: If `n` could be as large as `10^5`, would your solution still work fast enough? (for the sake of simplicity, let's not worry about precision here.)
