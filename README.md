## Purpose

- This assignment helps you review some of the basic concepts from Discrete Math / Data Structures course(s) that you may have taken at USF or elsewhere.
- It's strongly recommended that you attempt this assignment before the beginning of the fall semester, in order for you to check what you will need to review before the class (CS673) begins.
- If you can't solve or answer some of the questions, that's OK!  
  We'll review this on Day 1, but in the meantime, you should also review some of the topics listed in ["References"](https://github.com/hadenlee/cs673-f20-lab00/blob/master/README-Quiz.md#references).
- Enjoy!
